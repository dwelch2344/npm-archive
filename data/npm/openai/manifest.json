      "readme": "# OpenAI Node API Library\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/openai)\n\nThe OpenAI Node library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from applications written in server-side JavaScript.\nIt includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields.\n\n> ⚠️ **Important note: this library is meant for server-side usage only, as using it in client-side browser code will expose your secret API key. [See here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.completions.create({\n    model: 'text-davinci-002',\n    prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n    max_tokens: 6,\n    temperature: 0,\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst client = new OpenAI();\n\nconst stream = await client.completions.create({\n  prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n  model: 'text-davinci-003',\n  stream: true,\n});\nfor await (const part of stream) {\n  process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n}\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nImporting, instantiating, and interacting with the library are the same as above.\nIf you like, you may reference our types directly:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    model: 'text-davinci-002',\n    prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n    max_tokens: 6,\n    temperature: 0,\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Completion = await openai.completions.create(params);\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      }\n    });\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nopenai.embeddings.create({ model: 'text-similarity-babbage-001',input: 'The food was delicious and the waiter...' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nopenai.edits.create({ model: 'text-davinci-edit-001',input: 'What day of the wek is it?',instruction: 'Fix the spelling mistakes' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nopenai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThis package is in beta. Its internals and interfaces are not stable\nand subject to change without a major semver bump;\nplease reach out if you rely on any undocumented behavior.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher (experimental).\n  Use `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

[See here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.completions.create({\n    model: 'text-davinci-002',\n    prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n    max_tokens: 6,\n    temperature: 0,\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst client = new OpenAI();\n\nconst stream = await client.completions.create({\n  prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n  model: 'text-davinci-003',\n  stream: true,\n});\nfor await (const part of stream) {\n  process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n}\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nImporting, instantiating, and interacting with the library are the same as above.\nIf you like, you may reference our types directly:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    model: 'text-davinci-002',\n    prompt: 'Say this is a test',\n    max_tokens: 6,\n    temperature: 0,\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Completion = await openai.completions.create(params);\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      }\n    });\n}\nmain().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nopenai.embeddings.create({ model: 'text-similarity-babbage-001',input: 'The food was delicious and the waiter...' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nopenai.edits.create({ model: 'text-davinci-edit-001',input: 'What day of the wek is it?',instruction: 'Fix the spelling mistakes' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nopenai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThis package is in beta. Its internals and interfaces are not stable\nand subject to change without a major semver bump;\nplease reach out if you rely on any undocumented behavior.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher (experimental).\n  Use `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

[See here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nImporting, instantiating, and interacting with the library are the same as above.\nIf you like, you may reference our types directly:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThis package is in beta. Its internals and interfaces are not stable\nand subject to change without a major semver bump;\nplease reach out if you rely on any undocumented behavior.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher (experimental).\n  Use `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

[See here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nImporting, instantiating, and interacting with the library are the same as above.\nIf you like, you may reference our types directly:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Status\n\nThis package is in beta. Its internals and interfaces are not stable\nand subject to change without a major semver bump;\nplease reach out if you rely on any undocumented behavior.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher (experimental).\n  Use `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

[See here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Usage with TypeScript\n\nImporting, instantiating, and interacting with the library are the same as above.\nIf you like, you may reference our types directly:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nThis package generally attempts to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:\n\n1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.\n\nWe take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher (experimental).\n  Use `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

See the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217).\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.text || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Request & Response types\n\nThis library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields. You may import and use them like so:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default.

Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.\n\nWe take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher, using `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n  Deno Deploy is not yet supported.\n- Cloudflare Workers.\n- Vercel Edge Runtime.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

      "readme": "# OpenAI Node API Library\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/openai)\n\nThis library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.\n\nIt is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Previous versions of this SDK used a `Configuration` class. See the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217).\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Request & Response types\n\nThis library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields. You may import and use them like so:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)\n\nThe \"raw\" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.\n\nYou can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.\n\n```ts\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .asResponse();\nconsole.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object\n\nconst { data: completions, response: raw } = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .withResponse();\nconsole.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(completions.choices);\n```\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nThis package generally attempts to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:\n\n1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3.

      "readme": "# OpenAI Node API Library\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/openai)\n\nThis library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.\n\nIt is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Previous versions of this SDK used a `Configuration` class. See the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217).\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Request & Response types\n\nThis library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields. You may import and use them like so:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 60 seconds by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 60s)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)\n\nThe \"raw\" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.\n\nYou can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.\n\n```ts\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .asResponse();\nconsole.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object\n\nconst { data: completions, response: raw } = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .withResponse();\nconsole.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(completions.choices);\n```\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nThis package generally attempts to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:\n\n1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.\n\nWe take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher, using `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n  Deno Deploy is not yet supported.\n- Cloudflare Workers.\n- Vercel Edge Runtime.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

      "readme": "# OpenAI Node API Library\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/openai)\n\nThis library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.\n\nIt is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Previous versions of this SDK used a `Configuration` class. See the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217).\n\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n\n  console.log(completion.choices);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Side Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const part of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Request & Response types\n\nThis library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields. You may import and use them like so:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: 'my api key', // defaults to process.env[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"]\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.CompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const completion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const fineTune = await openai.fineTunes\n    .create({ training_file: 'file-XGinujblHPwGLSztz8cPS8XY' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 409 Conflict, 429 Rate Limit,\nand >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 10 minutes by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 10 minutes)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)\n\nThe \"raw\" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.\n\nYou can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.\n\n```ts\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .asResponse();\nconsole.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object\n\nconst { data: completions, response: raw } = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .withResponse();\nconsole.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(completions.choices);\n```\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nThis package generally attempts to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:\n\n1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.\n\nWe take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 16 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher, using `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n  Deno Deploy is not yet supported.\n- Cloudflare Workers.\n- Vercel Edge Runtime.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

  "readme": "# OpenAI Node API Library\n\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/openai.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/openai)\n\nThis library provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.\n\nIt is generated from our [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) with [Stainless](https://stainlessapi.com/).\n\nTo learn how to use the OpenAI API, check out our [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) and [Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openai\n# or\nyarn add openai\n```\n\nYou can import in Deno via:\n\n<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'https://deno.land/x/openai@v4.28.4/mod.ts';\n```\n\n<!-- x-release-please-end -->\n\n## Usage\n\nThe full API of this library can be found in [api.md file](api.md) along with many [code examples](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/tree/master/examples). The code below shows how to get started using the chat completions API.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\n## Streaming Responses\n\nWe provide support for streaming responses using Server Sent Events (SSE).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n  for await (const chunk of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from the loop\nor call `stream.controller.abort()`.\n\n### Request & Response types\n\nThis library includes TypeScript definitions for all request params and response fields. You may import and use them like so:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  apiKey: process.env['OPENAI_API_KEY'], // This is the default and can be omitted\n});\n\nasync function main() {\n  const params: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletionCreateParams = {\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n  };\n  const chatCompletion: OpenAI.Chat.ChatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create(params);\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nDocumentation for each method, request param, and response field are available in docstrings and will appear on hover in most modern editors.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Previous versions of this SDK used a `Configuration` class. See the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/217).\n\n### Streaming responses\n\nThis library provides several conveniences for streaming chat completions, for example:\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const stream = await openai.beta.chat.completions.stream({\n    model: 'gpt-4',\n    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }],\n    stream: true,\n  });\n\n  stream.on('content', (delta, snapshot) => {\n    process.stdout.write(delta);\n  });\n\n  // or, equivalently:\n  for await (const chunk of stream) {\n    process.stdout.write(chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '');\n  }\n\n  const chatCompletion = await stream.finalChatCompletion();\n  console.log(chatCompletion); // {id: \"…\", choices: […], …}\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nStreaming with `openai.beta.chat.completions.stream({…})` exposes\n[various helpers for your convenience](helpers.md#events) including event handlers and promises.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `openai.chat.completions.create({ stream: true, … })`\nwhich only returns an async iterable of the chunks in the stream and thus uses less memory\n(it does not build up a final chat completion object for you).\n\nIf you need to cancel a stream, you can `break` from a `for await` loop or call `stream.abort()`.\n\n### Automated function calls\n\nWe provide the `openai.beta.chat.completions.runTools({…})`\nconvenience helper for using function tool calls with the `/chat/completions` endpoint\nwhich automatically call the JavaScript functions you provide\nand sends their results back to the `/chat/completions` endpoint,\nlooping as long as the model requests tool calls.\n\nIf you pass a `parse` function, it will automatically parse the `arguments` for you\nand returns any parsing errors to the model to attempt auto-recovery.\nOtherwise, the args will be passed to the function you provide as a string.\n\nIf you pass `tool_choice: {function: {name: …}}` instead of `auto`,\nit returns immediately after calling that function (and only loops to auto-recover parsing errors).\n\n```ts\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst client = new OpenAI();\n\nasync function main() {\n  const runner = client.beta.chat.completions\n    .runTools({\n      model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',\n      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How is the weather this week?' }],\n      tools: [\n        {\n          type: 'function',\n          function: {\n            function: getCurrentLocation,\n            parameters: { type: 'object', properties: {} },\n          },\n        },\n        {\n          type: 'function',\n          function: {\n            function: getWeather,\n            parse: JSON.parse, // or use a validation library like zod for typesafe parsing.\n            parameters: {\n              type: 'object',\n              properties: {\n                location: { type: 'string' },\n              },\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      ],\n    })\n    .on('message', (message) => console.log(message));\n\n  const finalContent = await runner.finalContent();\n  console.log();\n  console.log('Final content:', finalContent);\n}\n\nasync function getCurrentLocation() {\n  return 'Boston'; // Simulate lookup\n}\n\nasync function getWeather(args: { location: string }) {\n  const { location } = args;\n  // … do lookup …\n  return { temperature, precipitation };\n}\n\nmain();\n\n// {role: \"user\",      content: \"How's the weather this week?\"}\n// {role: \"assistant\", tool_calls: [{type: \"function\", function: {name: \"getCurrentLocation\", arguments: \"{}\"}, id: \"123\"}\n// {role: \"tool\",      name: \"getCurrentLocation\", content: \"Boston\", tool_call_id: \"123\"}\n// {role: \"assistant\", tool_calls: [{type: \"function\", function: {name: \"getWeather\", arguments: '{\"location\": \"Boston\"}'}, id: \"1234\"}]}\n// {role: \"tool\",      name: \"getWeather\", content: '{\"temperature\": \"50degF\", \"preciptation\": \"high\"}', tool_call_id: \"1234\"}\n// {role: \"assistant\", content: \"It's looking cold and rainy - you might want to wear a jacket!\"}\n//\n// Final content: \"It's looking cold and rainy - you might want to wear a jacket!\"\n```\n\nLike with `.stream()`, we provide a variety of [helpers and events](helpers.md#events).\n\nNote that `runFunctions` was previously available as well, but has been deprecated in favor of `runTools`.\n\nRead more about various examples such as with integrating with [zod](helpers.md#integrate-with-zod),\n[next.js](helpers.md#integrate-wtih-next-js), and [proxying a stream to the browser](helpers.md#proxy-streaming-to-a-browser).\n\n## File Uploads\n\nRequest parameters that correspond to file uploads can be passed in many different forms:\n\n- `File` (or an object with the same structure)\n- a `fetch` `Response` (or an object with the same structure)\n- an `fs.ReadStream`\n- the return value of our `toFile` helper\n\n```ts\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport fetch from 'node-fetch';\nimport OpenAI, { toFile } from 'openai';\n\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\n// If you have access to Node `fs` we recommend using `fs.createReadStream()`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: fs.createReadStream('input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Or if you have the web `File` API you can pass a `File` instance:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: new File(['my bytes'], 'input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// You can also pass a `fetch` `Response`:\nawait openai.files.create({ file: await fetch('https://somesite/input.jsonl'), purpose: 'fine-tune' });\n\n// Finally, if none of the above are convenient, you can use our `toFile` helper:\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(Buffer.from('my bytes'), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\nawait openai.files.create({\n  file: await toFile(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2]), 'input.jsonl'),\n  purpose: 'fine-tune',\n});\n```\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWhen the library is unable to connect to the API,\nor if the API returns a non-success status code (i.e., 4xx or 5xx response),\na subclass of `APIError` will be thrown:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nasync function main() {\n  const job = await openai.fineTuning.jobs\n    .create({ model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', training_file: 'file-abc123' })\n    .catch((err) => {\n      if (err instanceof OpenAI.APIError) {\n        console.log(err.status); // 400\n        console.log(err.name); // BadRequestError\n        console.log(err.headers); // {server: 'nginx', ...}\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    });\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nError codes are as followed:\n\n| Status Code | Error Type                 |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- |\n| 400         | `BadRequestError`          |\n| 401         | `AuthenticationError`      |\n| 403         | `PermissionDeniedError`    |\n| 404         | `NotFoundError`            |\n| 422         | `UnprocessableEntityError` |\n| 429         | `RateLimitError`           |\n| >=500       | `InternalServerError`      |\n| N/A         | `APIConnectionError`       |\n\n### Azure OpenAI\n\nAn example of using this library with Azure OpenAI can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/master/examples/azure.ts).\n\nPlease note there are subtle differences in API shape & behavior between the Azure OpenAI API and the OpenAI API,\nso using this library with Azure OpenAI may result in incorrect types, which can lead to bugs.\n\nSee [`@azure/openai`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/openai) for an Azure-specific SDK provided by Microsoft.\n\n### Retries\n\nCertain errors will be automatically retried 2 times by default, with a short exponential backoff.\nConnection errors (for example, due to a network connectivity problem), 408 Request Timeout, 409 Conflict,\n429 Rate Limit, and >=500 Internal errors will all be retried by default.\n\nYou can use the `maxRetries` option to configure or disable this:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```js\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  maxRetries: 0, // default is 2\n});\n\n// Or, configure per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I get the name of the current day in Node.js?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  maxRetries: 5,\n});\n```\n\n### Timeouts\n\nRequests time out after 10 minutes by default. You can configure this with a `timeout` option:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  timeout: 20 * 1000, // 20 seconds (default is 10 minutes)\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.chat.completions.create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'How can I list all files in a directory using Python?' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' }, {\n  timeout: 5 * 1000,\n});\n```\n\nOn timeout, an `APIConnectionTimeoutError` is thrown.\n\nNote that requests which time out will be [retried twice by default](#retries).\n\n## Auto-pagination\n\nList methods in the OpenAI API are paginated.\nYou can use `for await … of` syntax to iterate through items across all pages:\n\n```ts\nasync function fetchAllFineTuningJobs(params) {\n  const allFineTuningJobs = [];\n  // Automatically fetches more pages as needed.\n  for await (const fineTuningJob of openai.fineTuning.jobs.list({ limit: 20 })) {\n    allFineTuningJobs.push(fineTuningJob);\n  }\n  return allFineTuningJobs;\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can make request a single page at a time:\n\n```ts\nlet page = await openai.fineTuning.jobs.list({ limit: 20 });\nfor (const fineTuningJob of page.data) {\n  console.log(fineTuningJob);\n}\n\n// Convenience methods are provided for manually paginating:\nwhile (page.hasNextPage()) {\n  page = page.getNextPage();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n### Accessing raw Response data (e.g., headers)\n\nThe \"raw\" `Response` returned by `fetch()` can be accessed through the `.asResponse()` method on the `APIPromise` type that all methods return.\n\nYou can also use the `.withResponse()` method to get the raw `Response` along with the parsed data.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst response = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .asResponse();\nconsole.log(response.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(response.statusText); // access the underlying Response object\n\nconst { data: chatCompletion, response: raw } = await openai.chat.completions\n  .create({ messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Say this is a test' }], model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo' })\n  .withResponse();\nconsole.log(raw.headers.get('X-My-Header'));\nconsole.log(chatCompletion);\n```\n\n## Customizing the fetch client\n\nBy default, this library uses `node-fetch` in Node, and expects a global `fetch` function in other environments.\n\nIf you would prefer to use a global, web-standards-compliant `fetch` function even in a Node environment,\n(for example, if you are running Node with `--experimental-fetch` or using NextJS which polyfills with `undici`),\nadd the following import before your first import `from \"OpenAI\"`:\n\n```ts\n// Tell TypeScript and the package to use the global web fetch instead of node-fetch.\n// Note, despite the name, this does not add any polyfills, but expects them to be provided if needed.\nimport 'openai/shims/web';\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n```\n\nTo do the inverse, add `import \"openai/shims/node\"` (which does import polyfills).\nThis can also be useful if you are getting the wrong TypeScript types for `Response` - more details [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/tree/master/src/_shims#readme).\n\nYou may also provide a custom `fetch` function when instantiating the client,\nwhich can be used to inspect or alter the `Request` or `Response` before/after each request:\n\n```ts\nimport { fetch } from 'undici'; // as one example\nimport OpenAI from 'openai';\n\nconst client = new OpenAI({\n  fetch: async (url: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInfo): Promise<Response> => {\n    console.log('About to make a request', url, init);\n    const response = await fetch(url, init);\n    console.log('Got response', response);\n    return response;\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNote that if given a `DEBUG=true` environment variable, this library will log all requests and responses automatically.\nThis is intended for debugging purposes only and may change in the future without notice.\n\n## Configuring an HTTP(S) Agent (e.g., for proxies)\n\nBy default, this library uses a stable agent for all http/https requests to reuse TCP connections, eliminating many TCP & TLS handshakes and shaving around 100ms off most requests.\n\nIf you would like to disable or customize this behavior, for example to use the API behind a proxy, you can pass an `httpAgent` which is used for all requests (be they http or https), for example:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n```ts\nimport http from 'http';\nimport HttpsProxyAgent from 'https-proxy-agent';\n\n// Configure the default for all requests:\nconst openai = new OpenAI({\n  httpAgent: new HttpsProxyAgent(process.env.PROXY_URL),\n});\n\n// Override per-request:\nawait openai.models.list({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080/test-api',\n  httpAgent: new http.Agent({ keepAlive: false }),\n})\n```\n\n## Semantic Versioning\n\nThis package generally follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) conventions, though certain backwards-incompatible changes may be released as minor versions:\n\n1. Changes that only affect static types, without breaking runtime behavior.\n2. Changes to library internals which are technically public but not intended or documented for external use. _(Please open a GitHub issue to let us know if you are relying on such internals)_.\n3. Changes that we do not expect to impact the vast majority of users in practice.\n\nWe take backwards-compatibility seriously and work hard to ensure you can rely on a smooth upgrade experience.\n\nWe are keen for your feedback; please open an [issue](https://www.github.com/openai/openai-node/issues) with questions, bugs, or suggestions.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTypeScript >= 4.5 is supported.\n\nThe following runtimes are supported:\n\n- Node.js 18 LTS or later ([non-EOL](https://endoflife.date/nodejs)) versions.\n- Deno v1.28.0 or higher, using `import OpenAI from \"npm:openai\"`.\n- Bun 1.0 or later.\n- Cloudflare Workers.\n- Vercel Edge Runtime.\n- Jest 28 or greater with the `\"node\"` environment (`\"jsdom\"` is not supported at this time).\n- Nitro v2.6 or greater.\n\nNote that React Native is not supported at this time.\n\nIf you are interested in other runtime environments, please open or upvote an issue on GitHub.\n",
